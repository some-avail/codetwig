What's new in CodeTwig?

1.65
- within search now you can use line-start-appending to uniquify overloaded names
  use like: someproc~linenumber
- to limit false positives, dec-usages are now limited to:
  - the imported modules
  - only declarations with the right boundary-characters are added
  (without param-evaluation false positives are still to be expected; however I have no plans to add  param-eval)


1.62
- removed bug caused by short project-names
- added declaration-types method, iterator and converter

1.61
- enable the showing of full declarational source-code with a new command -s
- improved comment-rendering

1.56
- recursive scanning of subdirs for source-files.
- multiproject enables creation of a multi-project declaration-list and thus treeviews
- add a flexible semicolumn-separated search: declaration;module;project


0.35
- Both in the views and in the tree-function the following information will be added:
  - procedural arguments
  - initial comments
