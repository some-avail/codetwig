CodeTwig can create special views of your programming-projects.

This is a multi-project-definition.
Multi-project-definitions have the extension .mul

After you have defined some projects in project-files (.pro),
you can create a multi-project-definition that enables you to show 
more projects at once; that is trees of usage and used-by.
